Decoding nature

Professor Joerg Blumtritt

Project #1 

The idea that i've had when creating project #1 was to create an interative solar system I have recreated the attractor using Danial Shiffman's code from the "Nature of code" The attractor attracts objects depending on the mass of the object, basically created a gravitational center of the solar system, like the Sun in our solar system.

I have made it interactive such that the user can choose the initial velocity of the created planets by simply clicking twice on the background. The distance between two clicks determines the initial velocity and also there is a mass scale which changes over time. So depending on when you click the mass of the planet will be different.
